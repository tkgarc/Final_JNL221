					When the COVID-19 pandemic stormed through the United States in 2020, prison admissions across 
					18 states fell sharply. Numbers dropped from 271,674 in 2019 to 104,074 in 2020 — a decrease of 
					more than 60%. At first glance, this looks like major progress in reducing incarceration. But a 
					closer look at the data shows that the drop did not affect everyone equally.

					New analysis shows that white people were released or avoided prison at much higher rates than 
					Black and Latino people. Even though fewer people went to prison overall, racial disparities 
					stayed in place — and in some cases worsened.

				<h3>Pandemic-Driven Admissions Masks Racial Imbalance</h3>
				<p>
					The data, which spans prison admissions from 2000 to 2022, shows that the biggest decline in 2020 came from the number of white people entering prisons. Black and brown individuals did not see an equal level of decrease. The results raise questions about why white admissions dropped so vastly, while admissions for people of color continued to grow. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Syracuse University law professor Paula C. Johnson, who studies race and the criminal justice system, said the numbers highlight historically long-standing issues.

			<h4>The pandemic didn’t erase injustice - it exposed it.</h4>
				<p>
					“Disproportionately, the number of people who are wrongly convicted in the U.S. are also people of color,” Johnson said. “From beginning to end, people of color often face harsher treatment in the system.”

				</p>

				<p>
					She added that nothing about the pandemic changed the root causes of unequal treatment. “There was nothing inherently criminal about people of color,” she said. “But the way the system treated them was always much harsher.”

				</p>
				<p>
					Johnson said the national protests in 2020 after George Floyd’s murder forced many Americans to confront racial injustice – but not everyone wanted change. “People had a decision to make,” she said. “Are we going to deal with this, or go back to the status quo?”
				</p>

			<div class="col-md">

				<h4>Why This Data Matters</h4>
				<p>
					Prison populations in the U.S. have long carried disproportionate representations of racial and ethnic minorities. While systemic racism in policing, prosecution and sentencing has been widely evident, the pandemic admission drop underscores how deeply structural inequities are embedded into our country. 

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md">
				<h4>Looking Ahead: Reform Initiatives</h4>
				<p>
					Johnson emphasized that since “the vast majority of people who are imprisoned are going to be released at some point,” society must ask: how do we want former prisoners to rejoin their communities? 
				</p>

				<p>
					“We’ve got to look at the race and gender issues associated with who’s in prison and why,” she said. “We can do a lot more in communities, you know, structures, institutions, organizations, and opportunities so that prison doesn't even seem like a likelihood for more people in our society.”
